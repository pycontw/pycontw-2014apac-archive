Using neural network in Python on vision\r\nrecognition is definitely interesting, however I'd like to see a more general\r\ncomparison and exploration, so audience can actually \"learn\" the concept of\r\nneural network and a general experience of the Python implementation after the\r\ntalk, so they could play with these take-home messages themselves.\r\n\r\nFor example, say normal NN models are trained based on backward propagation,\r\nit is good to explain how the backprop works in Python. Numpy may be heavily\r\nused, and there exists some trick for efficient Numpy matrix computation.\r\nAlso, it would be a lot easier to create new models (classifiers) if the code\r\nfor each neural layer is well modularized. Some popular Python NN libraries\r\nare available, they worth comparison (if one wants to) too. One may wish to\r\nleverage the computing power of GPU once the NN structure gets deeper and\r\nlarger. Explaining these general concepts could help audience jump into\r\nthe beautiful and fascinating machine learning world.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there leaves some technical stuff to be desired in his NN\r\nstructure design judging from a modern NN view. Firstly, the input size is\r\nway too small, using 10-by-10 pixel reduces the real world complexity too much.\r\nEven the MNIST hand written digit recognition dataset has higher input\r\ndimension. This also poses a limiting upper bound for accuracy. Secondly the\r\nmodel is too simple, most people call this a two-layer (or one hidden layer)\r\nneural network instead of three, where first layer usually doesn't count\r\n(since one \"train\" the input layer). He should try deeper neural network and\r\nvisualizing the weights learnt by the classifier. Current development of\r\nvisual NN heavily relies on the idea of convolutional neural network (CNN)\r\nwhich is biologically inspired so one could actually \"visualize\" those weights\r\nas colorful filters. We are not talking about the giant corporation-like\r\nImageNet CNN model with 10+ hidden layers and requires few days to train. One\r\nsimple CNN layer plus the fully connected layer would boost the performance\r\nsignificantly and brings a lot of insight that decades of research finally\r\nachieve and brings up a frenzy of the CNN era, which he should definitely try\r\nit in a 40min talk. Lastly, why 5 types of cats and why not crawl more cats\r\nfrom the internet? I think by supplying keyword to Flickr one could able to\r\ncreate a clean and large dataset (at least more than a hundred). Let alone the\r\n*evil* data augmentation process that utilizes cropping, color transformation\r\nfor creating more data to alleviate the over-fitting.\r\n\r\nBased on the above reason, the talk could be more constructive and\r\ninteresting.
